# Third-3rd-Empire-review-system-or-DRS


### DRS is a system in which you appeal to the onfield umpire and then your case is taken to 3rd Umpire. Third umpire has technology like Ultra edge, Hot Spot, Ball tracking. Hotspot has been criticized in recent times so Ultra edge is considered to ensure any contact between bat and ball
### The third umpire uses TV replays to rule on run outs, stumpings, whether a ball has hit the ground before being caught or when it is unclear if the ball has crossed the boundary. However, the third umpire can only make a decision if they have been asked to do so by the umpires out on the pitch.
